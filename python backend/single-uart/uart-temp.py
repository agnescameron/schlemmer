# Example of low level interaction with a BLE UART device that has an RX and TX
# characteristic for receiving and sending data.  This doesn't use any service
# implementation and instead just manipulates the services and characteristics
# on a device.  See the uart_service.py example for a simpler UART service
# example that uses a high level service implementation.
